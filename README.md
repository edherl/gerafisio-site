# GERAFISIO

Since 2013, the Study Group on Physiological Responses and Adaptations to Exercise at the State University of Ponta Grossa (GERAFISIO/UEPG) has been organizing meetings for presentations and discussions on topics related to applied physiology in sports and physical exercise.

The website was created by the group to promote its work and scientific publications, sharing findings with the scientific community and the general public to be utilized in advancing knowledge and contributing to practical problem-solving.

On the website, visitors will find information about the group's research areas, recent publications, and other activities related to their work.
